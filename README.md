# super-minimal-aurelia
A barebones Aurelia + webpack2 build

This boilerplate is up to date as of October 8th, 2017, and incorporates the following:

* An ES6-based Aurelia implementation (rather than Typescript)
* Code-splitting by routes (using latest syntax in Aurelia's router to designate chunk creation according to files under a route)
* Use of plain CSS (rather than SASS/LESS)
* Fully working in all evergreen browsers AND Internet Explorer 11, 10, and 9!

Here's all you need to get started. 

**Step 1)** Install the dependencies:

`npm install`

**Step 2)** Test it out in your browser (at http://localhost:8080):

`npm start`

**Step 3)** _(optional)_ Build an optimized version ready to upload to a web server:

`npm run prod`
